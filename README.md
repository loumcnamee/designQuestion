# SW Design question
I am kickstarting a software applciation targeting rich and famous grey beard software developers to manage their private libraries of stacks of books and heaps of music records and CDs. 

The application runs on a customer computer (laptop). 
The user must be able to:
1. Add a book/record/movie to the inventory
2. Remove a book/record/movie from the inventory
3. Loan a book/record/movie to another person
4. Search for a book/record/movie
5. View a report of the inventory of books/records/movies.
 
Propose a design of the application using C++ which
1. provides an interface enabling a front end UI to display indivual book or record data
2. provides an interface enabling a front end UI to display a list of books or records from a search query
3. supports all of the use cases listed above

The focus of this question is to showcase your object oriented design skills using C++
Key quality attributes to consider are:
1. Scalability
2. Mantainability
3. Testability
4. Performance
